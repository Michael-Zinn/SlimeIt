Help needed!
------------
The bukkit part of this plugin needs help from experienced Bukkit programmers. If you know how to program for bukkit, please fix the code.

Implementation overview:
------------------------
* This is an alpha version, so the implementation details will change a lot.
* BlockPunchListener reacts to what the player does.
* How the slime behaves is defined in SlimeRules.
* Cracked stone bricks are hardcoded
* MaterialData started as a simple combination of Material and Data but is now growing into a game element meta data library
